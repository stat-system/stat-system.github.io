S.T.A.T. is a system developed by a tutor for tutors. The product originated as the idea of a Computer Science tutor and a senior system administrator of a tutoring center as a replacement for other products on the market we had tried.

S.T.A.T. is user friendly, simple to use, and follows the [K.I.S.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) design principle in order to better serve both students and tutors.

S.T.A.T. also makes it much more easier to administer tutoring center functions with a single, CMS based system to keep everything simple and organized. S.T.A.T. also lets you run reports and notifications with a single click.
